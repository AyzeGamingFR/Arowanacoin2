## Falcon
Falcon [1] is a cryptographic signature algorithm submitted to NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Project.  
It has been designed by: Pierre-Alain Fouque, Jeffrey Hoffstein, Paul Kirchner, Vadim Lyubashevsky, Thomas Pornin, Thomas Prest, Thomas Ricosset, etc.  
The point of a post-quantum cryptographic algorithm is to keep on ensuring its security characteristics even faced with quantum computers. Quantum computers are deemed feasible, according to our current understanding of the laws of physics, but some significant technological issues remain to be solved in order to build a fully operational unit. Such a quantum computer would very efficiently break the usual asymmetric encryption and digitial signature algorithms based on number theory (RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman, ElGamal, and their elliptic curve variants).  

## Features
Post-Quantum Security: Rely on NIST(National Institute of Standards and Technology)'s finalists for Post-Quantum security standards  
Fast: Faster transaction speed  
Anti-Mining-machinery: CPU friendly, GPU unfriendly, FPGA/ASIC unfriendly  
Fairness: No icon, no airdrop, Pow only consensus  
Popularization: Mining with PC and Mobile Phone.
